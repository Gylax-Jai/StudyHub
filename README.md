# StudyHub
StudyHub is a secure and fully responsive full-stack web application designed to provide students with a centralized platform to access study materials. 
The platform includes a user authentication system with secure login and signup, protected content access, and a contact form for students to reach the admin. The backend ensures data security using hashed passwords, session-based authentication, and cybersecurity libraries. Built using MERN stack, the application offers a user-friendly experience across devices and restricts access to resources for unauthenticated users.
